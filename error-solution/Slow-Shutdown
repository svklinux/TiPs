Slow shutdown on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Stopping thermal daemon/running fit make remote CUPS printers)
=======================================================================================


a stop job is running for make remote CUPS printer available localy

When shuting down, it has a time out of 1m 30s. Stopping this service cause the shutdown process to take only few seconds.

So, I disabled it using this command line on Ubuntu Gnome 16.04:

# systemctl disable cups-browsed.service
