=========================================


Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file with a text editor, 
and wherever see the archive.ubuntu.com (the source of releases actively supported), 
change it to old-releases.ubuntu.com 


# vi /etc/apt/sources.list
....
:%s/archive.ubuntu/old-releases.ubuntu/g
:wq!
